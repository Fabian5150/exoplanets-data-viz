# DP&V
Project on Data Preprocessing and Visualization 
## TBD:
### Pre-processing:
+ Filter columns by how useable they are (not too many missing values)
+ Set threshold for amount of observations & age of discovery to ensure data reliability (and then filter the planets with that)
+ Get all values from the remaining columns for earth
+ Run PCA on the exoplanets & earth to get the planets closest to earth

### Visualisation:
